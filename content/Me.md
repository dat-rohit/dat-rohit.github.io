# Personal

This page contains the things that I study, do, enjoy and use.


## Language ##
---

**Computer**

Python: Because I do mostly ML/AI, I mostly use Python. I actually like the it a lot, and would be fine with using it forever if it wasn't so [slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock)

Assembly: Jumping quite a few layers of the tech stack, but I actually find comfort in extremely low level systems programming. I don't program in it much anymore, but still love the assembly programming puzzle games [Zachtronics](https://www.zachtronics.com/) pumps out.

Typescript: I've been [gaslit by the industry](https://dev.to/bobfirestone/i-give-up-atwood-s-law-won-7ic) into learning this language. Used to tinkering with this website.

**Human**

Vietnamese: I was born and raised in Vietnam, so I of course know this one fluently. Funnily enough, due to mostly interacting with adults growing up (and the fact that I only read Vietnamese books from the 1900s), I speak and write like an old man I also have a tendency to sprinkle in English words whenever I lack technical vocabulary, which happens a lot more than I'd like.

English: Before going into computers, I spent about half my life doing English Olympiads, of which I won a couple. I also worked as a language instructor for a couple of years, and gained a ton of teaching skills that I still find really helpful for techincal communication.

Japanese: One of my main hobbies. I started learning it about 2 years ago in an attempt to read the [Monogatari series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogatari_(series)) in the original text (due to it being widely known as being 'untranslatable'). I don't speak or write it much, nor do I have much time for dedicated learning these days, so I mostly just read manga and watch anime.

## Software ##
---

I use PopOS on all of my machines with the included tiling mananger and CLI for most computing tasks (I'm considering switching to Arch Linux, but that would take time, and I appreciate how easily PopOS handles my CUDA drivers). For consistency, I use the Catpuccin color theme for everything.

I live mostly in tmux, and primarily code in nvim with [nvchad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad). I use obsidian for editing markdown, which I use for my notes and for this website. I use firefox, with [vimium](https://vimium.github.io/), [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), [qBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) for downloads, Google Calendar for reminders and basic scheduling. Most of my programming is done in Python/bash, but I'm trying to fit zoomer languages like Rust and Typescript somewhere in there.

Miscellaneously, I use [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for spaced repetition, [ticktick](https://ticktick.com/?language=en_US) for convenient reminders that work between my device, [signal](https://signal.org/) for messaging, [tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/) for reading manga on my phone, and [manga-ocr](https://github.com/kha-white/manga-ocr) and [yomichan](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yomichan) for reading manga on my desktops.

## Hardware ##
---
Since May 2023, I've been using a Alienware PC that I scooped off of Ebay for a really good deal for deep learning and demoing AI applications. For IO, I use a [split keyboard](https://keeb.io/collections/iris-split-ergonomic-keyboard)(with lubed Boba U4Ts, and MT3 keycaps, of course), a [ball mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Ergo-M575-Wireless-Trackball-Black/dp/B08TLYK78K/ref=asc_df_B08TLYK78K/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=524539433517&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=18310067601708207989&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010927&hvtargid=pla-1184696876522&psc=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAuqKqBhDxARIsAFZELmLCIo31Tmac2gobJZS-hVxlFSviGLTFlc4dz76wTW8BJFhtdZoYUdAaAo9tEALw_wcB)and the [double you one thousand ex em four noise cancelling headphones](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/wh1000xm4-b).

Despite this fancy setup, I actually end up spending most of my time on my X1C6 Thinkpad at coffee shops and offices.

I also have a [cute kindle](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-adjustable-Ad-Supported/dp/B08KTZ8249) that definitely contain only legally obtained [[Books|books]].

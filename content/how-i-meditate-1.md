meditation requires a combination of extreme focus as well as extreme relaxation.
in large part, this is why it's so difficult to teach, learn, and generally describe.

one way that's made it really easy for me to think about meditation, is to imagine it
as stretching for the mind -- similarly strenuous, but requires the exact same combination
of extreme focus and relaxation.

i suspect that it's for this reason that many meditation practices focus heavily on yoga
(which are essentially stretching and balancing exercises) before full meditation.

this, and the upcoming series of essays will go over how i personally meditate. note that
i am an entirely self taught meditator. but then again, this essay is in no way intended
to be prescriptive, so make of this what you will!

## what does "mind body connection" even mean anyway?

are you sitting down? cool. ever thought about the way that feels? like really hard?

notice how your weight presses down on your chair (or bed, floor, bed of knives, etc).

notice the temperature difference between your skin and whatever you're sitting on. is it hotter?
colder? the same?

notice how these sensations change as you subtly sway back and fourth while breathing, or when
you adjust how you sit because your neck feels weird.

it's at this point, that your brain starts paying attention to some other stuff in your body:
the tension in your shoulders, or jaw (unclench your jaw btw), the dryness of your eyeballs (you should
use eyedrops more often), or your skin tingles in random spots every now and then (this is your body
telling you to moisturize more often).

"this", in essence, is all there is to the "mind body connection." it's paying attention to your
body, how it feels, and having thoughts about those feelings. while meditation looks more like
a "mind mind" connection (well, eventually it's a mind-nothing connection, then a "nothing-nothing" connection,
but let's not get ahead of ourselves), cultivating a decent connection between your mind and your body
serves as a good springboard for the other kinds of sensations that you'll be feeling over the 
course of a meditation practice.

## what does stretching have anything to do with meditation?

have you ever been hungover? lacked sleep? or just generally had a bad day?

do you notice how in those days, your mind doesn't really do that well at anything? i think basically
everyone can relate to something like this.

so everyone actually understands that there is such a thing as "being less attentive".

well, obviously, that implies that there is such a thing as "being more attentive" -- a state in which
you essentially have a higher "resolution" view of the world.

that brings us to stretching[^1]. stretching is one way to force yourself to gain a higher resolution
view of your body. it's effective because stretching acts as an enforced tutorial for developing
a more sensitive body.

okay touch your toe. do it right now actually. and no arching your back.

you feel how the back of your thighs (your hamstrings) starts burning?

okay, i'll give you a pro tip: you have to release the tension in your hamstrings, and let the
weight of your body pull yourself down to your toes.

you might notice at this point that it's kinda not enough to get to your toes[^2]. so what do?

now this is the hard part: you have to also lightly pull down with your quads (the muscles in the
front of your thighs).

yea, not easy right? you have to **both** let go, and actively do something at the same time.

this exercise, though simple, contains the essence of the activity i call "meditation", which is
basically:

> notice a thing, actively let go of thing, repeat

more concretely, meditation boils down to:

1. your brain has access to a bunch of sensors (like your 5 senses)
2. developing a heightened connection with these sensors not only gets you a higher
"resolution", but also a form of control over the sensors
> in other words, the sensors are also knobs you can dial
3. you actually have way more sensors than 5. (including all emotions)
4. you can learn to access and manipulate these sensors.
5. you will learn to let them go.

## your first meditation session

okay so you stretched a little. time for some real meditation!

while i promised no mumbo-jumbo, i made no such promise for scientific concepts. here's one really useful one:

[propioception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception) -- the "sense" of your body. most prominent of
which is its sense of location.

propioception forms the basis of what i feel is the easiest form of meditation (which is why i start all of
my sessions with it).

okay, i'll keep this brief so you don't have to check the instructions every 30 seconds:

1. sit down.
2. pay attention how your body feels.
3. keep your attention on that feeling.
4. notice how this is really hard.

that "really hard", is at the heart of why meditation is so helpful to people. and making it less hard
essentially perfectly correlates to being happy, content and focused.

if you'd like to peer behind that 4th step, go ahead and carry on to [part 2]()

or don't. i think this style of meditation is more than enough fun for most people.

[^1]: stretching is just good in general btw, and everyone should do it (todo: cite source about
how muscles bind up if you don't stretch)

[^2]: if it is enough for you, good job! you don't have steel cables for hamstrings

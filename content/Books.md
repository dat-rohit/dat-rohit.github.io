# Book I liked 

This list is just a ton of books that I've read and recommend. The goal is to eventually store a ton of reviews here, but I'm no [gwern type mf](https://gwern.net/review/book)

**These are my favorites**
- House of Leaves - Mark Z. Danielewski
> Redefined what a 'book' can be for me. Kept me up at 3 am for a month straight feeling like I'd stumbled upon a copy of the Necronomicon. It was the first thing I bought after landing in America. Constructed like a [matryoshka doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll) of a haunted house, a documentary, a tussle with academic writing, and, somewhere in that pile of notes, a love story. 
- [Football 17776](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football) - Jon Bois
> With pages embedded with Google Maps, and available exclusively through a sports website, this definitely rides the line in being called a 'book', but by god if Kojima can call MGS 4 a video game then I can call this one a book. Quintessential solar punk. Saying any more would be a spoiler, go read it!

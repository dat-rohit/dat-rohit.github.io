meditation requires a mix of extreme focus as well as extreme relaxation.
in large part, i think it's why it's so difficult to teach, learn, and generally describe.

i like to think of meditation as a way to stretch for the mind. similarly strenuous, but requires the same mix 
of focus and relaxation. i suspect that it's for this reason that many 
meditators focus heavily on yoga (which are just stretching 
and balancing exercises) before full meditation.

this first essay will focus on the "mind body connection": what it is, how to get it, and how to use it as a springboard for meditation.

these articles primarily meant for people who would like to get into meditation, but can't find a practical guide that doesn't involve reincarnation or some other spiritual stuff[^1].

note that i am an entirely self taught meditator. then again, this essay is in no way intended to be prescriptive, so make of this what you will!

## I. what does "mind body connection" even mean anyway?

are you currently sitting down? cool. ever thought about the way that feels? like really hard?

notice how your weight presses down on your chair (or bed, floor, etc).

notice the temperature of whatever you're sitting on. is it hotter?
colder? lukewarm?

notice how these sensations change as you subtly sway back and forth while breathing, or when you adjust how you sit because your neck feels off.

it's at this point, that your brain starts paying attention to some other sensations in your body:
the tension in your shoulders, or jaw (unclench your jaw btw), the dryness of your eyeballs (you should
use eyedrops more often), or how your skin tingles in random spots (this is your body telling you to moisturize more often).

these thoughts, in essence, are all there is to the "mind body connection." it's paying attention to your body, how it feels, and having thoughts about those feelings. 
while meditation looks more like a "mind-mind" connection[^2], building a good connection between your mind and your body serves as the ideal springboard for meditation as a whole.

## II. what does stretching have anything to do with meditation?

have you ever been hungover? lacked sleep? or just generally had a bad day?

do you notice during those moments, your mind can't really do well at anything in particular? it's a pretty universal experience.

we implicitly understand that there is such a thing as "being less attentive".

obviously, "less" implies that there is such a thing as "more attentive" -- a state in which you essentially have a higher "resolution" view of the world.

that brings us to stretching[^3], which is one way to force yourself to gain a higher resolution "picture" of your body. it's effective because stretching acts as an enforced tutorial for developing a more sensitive body.

okay touch your toe. do it right now! and no arching your back!

you feel how the back of your thighs (your hamstrings) starts burning?

a pro tip: you have to release the tension in your hamstrings, and let the weight of your body pull yourself down to your toes.

notice at this point how it's kinda not enough to get to your toes[^4]? what do?

this is the tricky part: you have to also slightly pull down with your quads (the muscles in the front of your thighs). this will get you enough depth to easily touch your toes.

yea, not easy right? it's the fact you have to **both** let go, and actively do something else at the same time.

this exercise, though simple, contains the essence of the activity i call "meditation", which is essentially:

> notice a thing, actively let go of thing, repeat.

more concretely, meditation boils down to:

1. your brain has access to a bunch of sensors (like your 5 senses)
2. developing a heightened connection with these sensors not only gets you a higher "resolution", but also a form of control over the sensors. in other words, the sensors are also knobs that you can dial.
3. you actually have way more sensors than 5. (including all emotions)
4. you can learn to access and manipulate these sensors.
5. you will learn to let them go.

## III. the guide 

now that you've stretched a little. time for some real meditation!

### 1. the pre-pre-meditation

while not strictly necessary, it's at this point that you'll want to shut off your phone. i'm
not exactly sure what it is about the phone, but its presence usually spells loss of focus before and while meditating. so if you're reading this on your phone, i'd advise you to move to a laptop or desktop before continuing.

my guess is that it's the ambient tension of a possible notification that makes the phone so distracting. it's basically attentional russian roulette. don't do it! mute it, turn it off, chuck it into a [faraday cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage), whatever it takes for you to be absolutely sure that it won't ring for the next hour or so.

however, if you find yourself in a situation in which you **need** to have your phone on speed dial all the time (medical professional, parent, etc):

- for one: i'm very sorry.
- but for two: know that possible to meditate even with these distractions. it's just going to be slightly harder. in fact, being able to focus even with distractions is a major roadblock later on, so think of it as skipping a couple classes.

### 2. the pre-meditation

while also not strictly necessary, doing some extra prep work before meditating usually heightens your senses, and gives some time for you to mull over some compulsive thoughts -- both of which are really helpful for keeping focus later on when meditating.

my flavor of prep is already described in this article -- stretching. i usually focus on the ones that are the most tense[^6]. i won't go into too much detail on how to do these[^7], so i'll just list the muscle groups i focus on:

- hamstring.
- quads.
- shoulders. 
- hip flexor. 
- neck. 
- wrist (i'm a programmer, and spend 8 hours a day typing).

of course, while you do this, you'll want to pay attention not only to the way your body feels, but also
to the frequent distracting thoughts you'll encounter. these are really hard to get
rid of, and are basically the major [skillcheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill_assessment)
for unlocking deeper meditation. i'll detail some 
effective techniques to get rid of them in a future blog post, but for now, just notice that they're there, and try your best to ignore
them.

### 3.3 the meditation

while i promised no mumbo-jumbo, i made no such promise for scientific concepts. here's one really useful word:

[proprioception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception) -- a.k.a the "sense" of your body -- the most prominent of which is its sense of location. if this is a bit confusing, try to reflect a bit on this question:

**"where are you?"**

i'm not talking about address or zip code obviously. instead, think about where is it that you feel "you" are most located. it's very unlikely that it'll be your arms. for a lot of modern people, it's
most likely going to be somewhere in the upper body, like your heart, or your head

funnily enough, it doesn't even have to be your head! it can even be your [liver](https://psyche.co/ideas/to-ancient-assyrians-the-liver-was-the-seat-of-happiness).

for this meditation tutorial boss, you'll just want to just pay attention to this sensation. "feel where you are, really hard".

while it sounds trivial, proprioception forms the basis of what i feel is the most cost effective form of meditation[^8].

i've tried a handful of other meditation techniques (breathwork and third eye
meditation specifically), and my sense is that these require too many variables ("oh no my nose is stuck",
"what the hell do you mean 'third eye'" are thoughts that come to mind) to be worth starting off with.

not that they're useless, but for now, i'll keep this simple and brief:

- sit down.
- pay attention how your body feels.
- keep your attention on that feeling.
- notice how this is like, **really hard.**

that "really hard", is at the heart of why meditation is so helpful to many people. making that step less hard almost perfectly correlates to being happy, content and focused.


### 4. some notes

note on chronology: these sorts of sessions can last anywhere from 5-10 minutes, to hours. i usually go for 20 minutes (until i descend into deeper meditation, or until i get up and do something else)

note on geography: it doesn't usually matter too much where you meditate. with enough skill, you can in fact just meditate during your morning commute and effectively time skip. but until then, sitting down in a quiet room is good place to start. there is definitely no "best location", so have fun experimenting with meditation in different locations and scenarios. (my favorite is the aforementioned time skipping during commutes technique)

note on "doing it right": fortunately, there really isn't a wrong way to meditate so as long as you make sure two things are happening:
- you aren't doing anything distracting, like scrolling tiktok.
- you're paying attention to what you feel.

## so what does this buy you?

so why do all of this work? what's the point?

while i can't speak universally, i can list the benefits meditation has given me in the past 5-6 years of practice:

- heightened mind body connection: unsurprisingly, doing the thing makes you better at doing the thing. tremendously helpful for physical skill acquisition, like playing instruments, rock climbing, or lifting, to name a few
- mental clarity: going through the **really hard** step of the meditation exercise basically does something to the effect of mental [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)).

my compulsive thoughts don't really go away until they're resolved, and they're usually not resolved until i force myself to sit down and mull over them for a while. meditation is a really good place to do just that.

- creative ideation: much like long walks and hot showers, meditation is where a lot of my good ideas spring up. it's not a conscious action by any means. the combination of attentiveness plus
the clearing up of mental gunk creates a good environment for my brain to iron out a couple ideas, be it for writing or engineering.

and a couple more that i'll detail in a future part:
- resolving years old mental anguish.
- understanding the atomic components of consciousness.
- unlocking the ["happy" button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhyana_in_Buddhism#The_jh%C4%81na/dhyana-stages).
- and much more!

[^1]: though that spiritual stuff is also part of the practical side of meditation. i like to 
think of them as bug fixes to enlightenment.exe, the program.

[^2]: well, it's a mind-nothing connection, until it becomes a "nothing-nothing" connection, but let's not get ahead of ourselves

[^3]: stretching is just good in general by the way, and 
[everyone should do it.](https://time.com/6965081/is-stretching-important-exercise/)

[^4]: if it is enough for you, good job! you don't have steel cables for hamstrings.

[^5]: measured by how little i get distracted while i meditate.

[^6]: if you don't know which these are, you'll find out once you start meditating. it'll start annoying
you like hell.

[^7]: there are great tutorials on youtube, i like [movementbydavid](https://www.youtube.com/@MovementbyDavid)
and [hybridcalisthenics](https://www.youtube.com/@HybridCalisthenics) in particular.

[^8]: which is why i start all of my sessions with it.

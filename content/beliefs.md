---

this article contains my current set of beliefs. while my belief in them are strong, i'm not particularly attached, and will throw them out if a better theory presents itself. expect articles on some of these in the future.

## AI ##
- intelligence is [compression](http://prize.hutter1.net/)
- AGI (artificial general intelligence) can be defined as a method to derive prediction (compression) algorithms on all modalities
- AGI is already here, in the form of our optimization algorithms, not in any specific model like GPT-4 or Claude
- the issue of AI consciousness is legal and ethical, not scientific. it will be resolved in either the court, or the bedroom

## Linguistic ##
- everything humans do is language
- [the meaning of a word is how it's used](https://wab.uib.no/agora/tools/alws/collection-5-issue-1-article-27.annotate)
- language learning is all about language comprehension. language comprehension is all about [comprehensible input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUc_W3xE1w)

## Philosophical ##
- all theories are wrong, some are useful
- P != NP
- science is "okay" 
- objectivism is misguided
- evil resides within all human hearts. evil people are those who act them out
- [buddhists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) roughly have it all figured out
- [infinity isn't real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_infinity)
- blind faith is an underused tactic in justifying one's belief

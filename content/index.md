Hi there, I'm Mike Doan. I'm a computer science major specializing in ML/AI. I currently work part time as a software engineer at a neuroimaging center and spend most of my time making data generation pipelines that run on [big computers](https://arctic.gsu.edu/). 

I have a ton of interests, including linguistics, programming languages, music theory, manga and rock climbing.

You can reach me through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/spikedoanz) or email me at spikedoanz@gmail.com

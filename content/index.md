Hi there, I'm Mike Doan. I'm a computer science major specializing in ML/AI. I currently work part time as a software engineer at a neuroimaging center making data generation pipelines that run on [big computers](https://arctic.gsu.edu/). 

I have far too many interests for my own good, including linguistics, programming languages, music theory, manga and rock climbing.

**Personal**

I listen to bossa nova, funk, fusion jazz and city pop predominantly, and am currently learning to play the bass. I played piano for a couple of years but moving to the States meant I unfortunately couldn't take my instrument with me.

I'm an avid boulderer, but mostly climb at gyms these days due to work. I also lift recreationally, for bench, squat and deadlift is 990 lbs (450 kg)

gaining signal as a consumser quite trivial -- just a game of wackamole.

block, mute, whitelist, blacklist. can't have too much of a good thing.

gaining signal as a producer is less easy, because it's a system of differential equations:

**what feedback you get is dependent on what you post.**

**what you post is dependent on what feedback you get.**

get the variables wrong, you'll start posting [slop](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Slop%20Content).

and if you're posting slop; you become slop.

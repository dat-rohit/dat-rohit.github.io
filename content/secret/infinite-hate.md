what is infinity? it can be defined, in a sense as "unboundedness".

it is not a number. this is 'potential infinity'.

many things are potentially infinite, like time (debatable).

there is another kind of infinity, however, called 'actual infinity'.

actual infinities do not exist. one can never **have** an unbounded thing.

yet it is an important axiom of two very important fields -- math and computation.

from math, there is the axiom of infinity -- 'there exists an infinite set'

from computation, there are turing machines -- which have not only unbounded time, but also include potentially unbounded sequences of computation.

and from both, arise paradoxes.

math has godel incompleteness -- talking about infinity disallows your language from being complete.

computation has the halting problem -- attempting from to actualize a potentially infinite process disallows your abilty to talk about it.

it does not end here.

this article discusses the many other reasons why infinity sucks, and why you never needed it in the first place.

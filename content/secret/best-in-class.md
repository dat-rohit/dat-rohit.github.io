general problem solving looks something like a search problem. naively, you can do something like:

try out ONE thing until it either works or fails. this is depth first search.

or try out MANY things all at once, and hope that one lands. this is breadth first search.

efficient problem solving finds a balance between these two approaches, weighing up the pros and cons of exploration vs exploitation; RL 101 stuff.

i propose a valid alternate strategy.

it's called cheating.

(aka looking at the back of the book, aka learning from the best)

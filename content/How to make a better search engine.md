- Google SUCKS
- Decent candidates to replace PageRank or whatever google uses:
	- Semantic similarity in embeddings (perplexity.ai)
	- Entropy (specificity and novelty of new content), the aim is to maximize the amount that users learn per query. This sometimes doesn't translate to giving them what they want
		- If someone googles 'best programming language,' Google should not return 'Python.' Instead, it should redirect them towards this [Geohot video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2bXEUSAiTI)
Problem statement: How do you define the entropy/info gain of 'knowledge'?

## work

i wrote and currently manage [wirehead](https://github.com/neuroneural/wirehead), a distributed cache for scaling synthetic data generation. 
- it scaled [synthseg](https://github.com/BBillot/SynthSeg), a fMRI brain scan generator by 170x baseline.
- currently cooperating with some folks at MIT help them scale their other projects.
- shortened experiment turnaround times from > 7 days to ~4 hours.
- there is a paper (in peer review).

i accidentally wrote the fastest [tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/spikedoanz/tensor-tic-tac-toe) implementation in ~30 LOC.
- written in tinygrad, runs on gpu.
- generalizes to all 2d tic-tac-toe variants (and can be extended to higher dimensions).

i wrote [brainrot.nvim](https://github.com/spikedoanz/brainrot.nvim), a subway surfer extension for neovim.

i can write an [autograd engine](https://github.com/spikedoanz/weenygrad) from scratch.

i know how computers work pretty well. i can write:
- an [assembler](https://x.com/spikedoanz/status/1809745164434604118).
- a [risc-v software simulator](https://x.com/spikedoanz/status/1810068197497778646).
- a [compiler](https://x.com/spikedoanz/status/1810764530089132424).

i wrote a [wandb clone](https://github.com/spikedoanz/wandbinhood) that looks exactly like robinhood.

i can program in a number of languages:
- python (torch, tinygrad).
- gpu (cuda, triton).
- rust.

modern search engines (google, youtube, twitter, ddg), largely suck despite having all the compute and data you could ever ask for.

endless SEO-gaming, AI generated slop and and all incentives pointing towards mindless entertainment "content" certainly doesn't help. 

the only real protection we have, is to bookmark. or have curators (outsourced bookmarking) do it for us.

but bookmarking (with your browser, on twitter, on youtube with likes/playlists) poses a few problems shared with every other centralized service.

compare things like notion versus stuff like obsidian.

with notion-likes:
- you can't export your notes, or it's a proprietary format.
- you're powerless if whoever's hosting it takes it down.
- oh but it's so convenient though.

with obsidian-likes:
- it's just markdown files man. 
- it's JUST MARKDOWN FILES MAN.
- host it anywhere, or don't (use it locally only for security).
- or pay someone to do it for you for a cheap. (obsidian sync, etc)

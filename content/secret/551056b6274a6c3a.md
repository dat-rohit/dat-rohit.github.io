### experience

<h4 style="text-align:center;">TReNDS Center :: research scientist :: 2023-2024</h4>

- led the design and engineering for wirehead, an open source tool for scaling synthetic data generation that shortened model training times from over **1 week to just 4 hours**, now deployed in neuroimaging labs at MIT, Harvard, GaTech and Emory
- collaborated with dozens of clinicians, radiologists, and other researchers for brain segmentation and brain lesion detection

<h4 style='text-align:center;'>MORSE Studio :: research assistant :: 2021-2022</h4>

- assisted with ml based robotics projects, including satellites for meteorology research, and soil quality detection robots
- responsible for data cleaning and annotation, processing over 2 years of time series data for weather prediction

### work 

- i wrote and currently maintain [wirehead](https://github.com/neuroneural/wirehead), an open source distributed cache for massively scaling synthetic data generation using MongoDB

- i contributed brain segmentation models and code to [brainchop.org](https://brainchop.org/) and ported it to [brainchop-cli](https://github.com/neuroneural/brainchop-cli)

- i wrote the world's fastest [tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/spikedoanz/tensor-tic-tac-toe) implementation in ~30 LOC


### proficiencies

- machine learning: python torch, tinygrad, cuda

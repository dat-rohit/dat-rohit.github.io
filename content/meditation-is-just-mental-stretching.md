meditation requires a combination of extreme focus as well as extreme relaxation.
in large part, this is why it's so difficult to teach, learn, and generally describe.

one way that's made it really easy for me to think about meditation, is to imagine it
as stretching for the mind -- similarly strenuous, but requires the exact same combination
of extreme focus and relaxation. i suspect that it's for this reason that many 
meditation practices focus heavily on yoga (which are essentially stretching 
and balancing exercises) before full meditation.

this, and the upcoming series of essays will go over how i personally meditate. note that
i am an entirely self taught meditator. then again, this essay is in no way intended
to be prescriptive, so make of this what you will!

these articles primarily meant for people who would like to get into meditation, but can't
find a practical guide that doesn't involve reincarnation or some other spiritual stuff[^1].

this first essay will focus on the "mind body connection": what it is, how to get it, how to
use it, and how to use it as a springboard for meditation.

---

## 1. what does "mind body connection" even mean anyway?

are you sitting down? cool. ever thought about the way that feels? like really hard?

notice how your weight presses down on your chair (or bed, floor, bed of knives, etc).

notice the temperature difference between your skin and whatever you're sitting on. is it hotter?
colder? the same?

notice how these sensations change as you subtly sway back and forth while breathing, or when
you adjust how you sit because your neck feels weird.

it's at this point, that your brain starts paying attention to some other stuff in your body:
the tension in your shoulders, or jaw (unclench your jaw btw), the dryness of your eyeballs (you should
use eyedrops more often), or your skin tingles in random spots every now and then (this is your body
telling you to moisturize more often).

"this", in essence, is all there is to the "mind body connection." it's paying attention to your
body, how it feels, and having thoughts about those feelings. while meditation looks more like
a "mind mind" connection[^2], cultivating a decent connection between your mind and your body
serves as a good springboard for the other kinds of sensations that you'll be feeling over the 
course of a meditation practice.

---

## 2. what does stretching have anything to do with meditation?

have you ever been hungover? lacked sleep? or just generally had a bad day?

do you notice how in those days, your mind doesn't really do that well at anything? i think basically
everyone can relate to something like this.

so everyone actually understands that there is such a thing as "being less attentive".

well, obviously, that implies that there is such a thing as "being more attentive" -- a state in which
you essentially have a higher "resolution" view of the world.

that brings us to stretching[^3]. stretching is one way to force yourself to gain a higher resolution
view of your body. it's effective because stretching acts as an enforced tutorial for developing
a more sensitive body.

okay touch your toe. do it right now actually; and no arching your back!

you feel how the back of your thighs (your hamstrings) starts burning?

okay, i'll give you a pro tip: you have to release the tension in your hamstrings, and let the
weight of your body pull yourself down to your toes.

you might notice at this point that it's kinda not enough to get to your toes[^4]. so what do?

now this is the hard part: you have to also lightly pull down with your quads (the muscles in the
front of your thighs).

yea, not easy right? you have to **both** let go, and actively do something at the same time.

this exercise, though simple, contains the essence of the activity i call "meditation", which is
basically:

> notice a thing, actively let go of thing, repeat

more concretely, meditation boils down to:

1. your brain has access to a bunch of sensors (like your 5 senses)
2. developing a heightened connection with these sensors not only gets you a higher
"resolution", but also a form of control over the sensors
> in other words, the sensors are also knobs you can dial
3. you actually have way more sensors than 5. (including all emotions)
4. you can learn to access and manipulate these sensors.
5. you will learn to let them go.

## 3. the guide 

okay so you stretched a little. time for some real meditation!

so without further ado, here it is, the first 30 minutes of my meditation session:

### 3.1 the pre-pre-meditation

while not strictly necessary, it's at this point that you'll want to shut off your phone. i'm
not exactly sure what it is about the phone, but its presence (even reading an article), usually
spells bad habits, and loss of focus while meditating. so if you're reading this on your phone,
i'd advise you to move to a laptop or desktop if you plan to read this and meditate.

my guess is that it's the ambient tension of a possible notification that makes the phone so
distracting. it's basically attentional russian roulette. don't do it! mute it, turn it off,
chuck it into a [faraday cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage), whatever it takes
for you to be absolutely sure that it won't ring for the foreseeable future.

however if you find yourself in a situation in which you **need** to have your phone on speed dial
basically always (medical professional, parent, etc):

- for one: i'm very sorry.
- but for two: please know that it's not impossible to meditate even with these 
distractions. it's just going to be slightly harder. being able to focus even with
distractions is a major skill check later on, so think of it as skipping a couple classes.

### 3.2 the pre-meditation

while also not strictly necessary, doing some extra prep work before meditating usually heightens 
your senses, and gives some time for you to mull over some compulsive thoughts -- both of which
are really helpful for keeping focus later on when meditating.

my flavor of prep is already described in this article -- stretching. i usually focus on the ones
that are the most tense[^6]. i won't go into too much detail on how to do these[^7], so i'll just
list the muscle groups i focus on:

- hamstring stretches.
- quad stretches
- shoulder stretches
- hip flexor stretch
- arm circles
- neck circles
- wrist circles (i'm a programmer, and spend 8 hours a day typing)

of course, while you do this, pay attention not only to the way your body feels, but also
to the distracting thoughts you'll be having while you do it. these are really hard to get
rid of, and are basically the major [skillcheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill_assessment)
for meditation. i'll detail a couple of
effective ways to get rid of them in a future blog post, but for now, just note that they're there.

### 3.3 the meditation

while i promised no mumbo-jumbo, i made no such promise for scientific concepts. here's one really useful one:

[proprioception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception) -- a.k.a the "sense" of your body. the 
most prominent of which is its sense of location. if this is a bit confusing, think a bit about this
question:

**"where are you?"**

i'm not talking about what building or zip code obviously. but instead about where is it that you feel
"you" are most located. it's very unlikely that it'll be your arms. for a lot of modern people, it's
most likely going to be the head.

funnily enough, it doesn't even have to be your head! it can even be your 
[liver](https://psyche.co/ideas/to-ancient-assyrians-the-liver-was-the-seat-of-happiness). or your
heart.

if this is a bit too abstract, try using your center of mass, that usually also works fine for this
exercise. in fact, "center of mass" is just one special case of proprioception.

for this meditation tutorial boss, you'll
want to just pay attention to how your body sits.

while it sounds trivial, proprioception forms the basis of what i feel is 
the effective form of meditation[^8] .

this is simple by design. i've tried a handful of other meditation methods (breathwork and third eye
meditation specifically), and my sense is that these require too many variables ("oh no my nose is stuck",
"what the hell do you mean 'third eye'" are thoughts that come to mind) to start of with.

not that they're useless. we'll revisit them in a later session, but for now, i'll 
keep this brief so you don't have to check the instructions every 30 seconds:

1. sit down.
2. pay attention how your body feels.
3. keep your attention on that feeling.
4. notice how this is like, really hard.

that "really hard", is at the heart of why meditation is so helpful to people. and making it less hard
almost perfectly correlates to being happy, content and focused.


## 3.4 errata

note on chronology: these sorts of sessions can last anywhere from 5-10 minutes, to hours. your milage may
vary. i usually go for 20 minutes (until i descend into deeper meditation, or get up and
do something else)

note on geography: it doesn't usually matter too much where you meditate. with enough skill, you can in
fact just meditate during your morning commute and effectively time skip. but until then, sitting down
in a quiet room is a good middle ground. there is no "best", and there's lots of fun to be found in
experimenting with meditation in different locations and scenarios. (my favorite is time skipping during
commutes)

note on "doing it right": fortunately, there really isn't a wrong way to meditate
so as long as you make sure two things are happening:
- you aren't doing anything distracting, like scrolling tiktok.
- you're paying attention to what you feel.

## what does this buy you?

so why do all of this work? what's the point of all this?

while i can't speak universally, i list the benefits that this particular meditation exercise has given
me in the 5-6ish years of on and off meditation practice:

- heightened mind body connection: unsurprisingly, doing the thing makes you better at the thing.
this has helped for physical skill acquisition (playing instruments, rock climbing, lifting to name a few)
- mental clarity: going through the really hard step 4 of the meditation exercise basically acts
like [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) for the mind.
most persistent thoughts don't go away until they're resolved, and they're usually not resolved until
i sit down and mull over them for a while. meditation is a really good place to do just that.
- creative ideation: much like taking long walks, or showers, meditation is where a lot of my good
ideas spring up. it's not a conscious action by any means. i think the combination of attentiveness plus
the clearing up of mental gunk creates a good environment for my brain to iron out a couple ideas for writing
or engineering.

and the inkling of a couple more that i'll detail in a future part:
- resolving years old mental anguish.
- unlocking the "happy" button.
- understanding the atomic components of consciousness.
- and much more!

if you liked this essay, or want updates on when those future parts drop, 
feel free to send me a message on my [twitter](https:/x.com/spikedoanz).

[^1]: though that spiritual stuff is also part of the practical side of meditation. i like to 
think of them as bug fixes to enlightenment.exe, the program.

[^2]: well, eventually it's a mind-nothing connection, then a "nothing-nothing" connection,
but let's not get ahead of ourselves

[^3]: stretching is just good in general btw, and 
[everyone should do it.](https://time.com/6965081/is-stretching-important-exercise/)

[^4]: if it is enough for you, good job! you don't have steel cables for hamstrings.

[^5]: measured by how little i get distracted while i meditate.

[^6]: if you don't know which these are, you'll find out once you start meditating. it'll start annoying
you like hell.

[^7]: there are great tutorials on youtube, i like [movementbydavid](https://www.youtube.com/@MovementbyDavid)
and [hybridcalisthenics](https://www.youtube.com/@HybridCalisthenics) in particular.

[^8]: which is why i start all of my sessions with it.

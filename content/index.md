hi there, I'm Mike. I'm trying to make ^^^^ a reality.

I'm currently juggling between being a full time student, a part time software engineer at [TReNDS Center](https://trendscenter.org/), and building some tools at AI-bo to help people prepare for a future where AIs and humans coexist.

**projects:**

[gptnum.py](https://github.com/spikedoanz/GPTnum.py): hands on numpy only implementation of GPT I did as a learning project with no prior experience. Taught me a lot about how transformers worked and a lot of the technical specifics of the GPT models

**poindexter**: sweet and short summarizer bot me and a coworker made over a couple of days. Currently running on the company Slack at TReNDS Center, and a great help in letting me and other people ping papers to one another easily

**man vs digital oracle:** attempt to investigate whether it was possible to say anything at all about astrology using "state-of-the-art" machine learning techniques. *Turns out, astrology isn't real!!*

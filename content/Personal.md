## Language ##
---

**Computer**

Python: I'm a huge python simp. This is because the language is not only [good](https://www.fluentpython.com/), but also [fast](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad). 

Assembly: I hate abstractions for the most part so I sometimes code in assembly for [fun](https://www.zachtronics.com/).  

**Human**

Vietnamese: I was born and raised in Vietnam, so Vietnamese is my mother tongue. I suck a lot more at it than I'd like though :')

English: I then spent the majority of my adolescence doing English Olymiads, and would've probably lined myself up for a job as a professional translator if I hadn't gotten into computers.

Japanese: I know enough to read manga.

My all time favorite comfort media.

Years ago, back when I was a bit more prone to bouts of weekend depression, I remember telling friends: "If you hear anything about me re-watching/reading Horimiya, it's a call for help."

And though I no longer watch it as often anymore (both because I'm in a much better place mentally now, thanks for asking; and because it got to the point where I started memorizing whole episodes line by line), Horimiya still holds strong in my mind as one of the best well oiled pieces of story telling machinery ever put to animation.

There's a definition of the word 'creative' that I heard a long time ago that I really liked. It went something like

```
When faced with a new idea, an uncreative person (who is otherwise perfectly intelligent), will come out with just as many ideas as they are told.

A normal person might bump this up to 2 -- equivalent exchange. They can extend an idea, but the sum number of novel ideas in the world remains roughly the same.

For a creative, this number is 10 fold. Leave a creative a tiny little interesting breadcrumb, and they'll retort back with new, interesting ideas so fast that you can hardly believe they hadn't heard the thing before.
```

Certain works have the power to make me feel like a creative. Pale Cocoon is one such case. For 20 minutes, every second, and every scene, and every piece of technology and skyline and faded photograph and facial expression and fragment of history, tastes, like how I imagine, one of those creative breadcrumbs tastes.

I've watched Bakemonogatari three times.

Once, as a young teenager, on the recommendation of my older brother. I got the impression that it was a very weird show by very weird Japanese people whose editing style made me press the pause button a whole ton to catch all of the text dumps.

Twice, as a college freshman, revisiting the whole Monogatari series as a literary work after reading a ton of essays. I found the themes of dealing with mental illness quite intruiging. The weird editing and characters had also grown on me in the mean time. It was then that I realized that the Monogatari series was one that definitely got better on rewatches. After this second rewatch, I promised myself that I would learn Japanese for the _sole_ purpose of one day properly watching Bakemonogatari.

Then thrice, finally, with subtitles off, a month after college graduation. This time around, I found Bakemonogatari to be an incredibly endearing love story. This became even more poignant as episode 12 came along, and supercell's _kimi no shiranai monogatari_ started blasting; I realized that the lyrics were actually telling the story as a love letter, from Senjougahara's point of view. I was love struck before, and I fell in love with the series all over again at that moment.

Perfectly bittersweet.

The art is just utterly gorgeous. The airial shots of Japanese cities at night look like Shinkai just ripped them straight out of my memory.

The first part by itself is an easy 10/10, though the writing and presentation falls off a little bit for the second and third parts. As a whole, I'd say the piece sits comfortably at a nine-ish.

Part of it is that I'm not really sure how a space ship, or surfing, or much of the rest of it fit together with the main thread of Takeki, Akari and Kanae's awkward little injective romance. They definitely made for some good imagery, so who cares right?

This is Makoto Shinkai's best work in my eyes, even though I'd say I enjoyed _watching_ Your Name more overall.

Katanagatari is, in many ways, Nishio Isshin-lite.

The story is much more straight forward (maybe too straight forward, since they manage to spoil the goddamn thing at the end of every previous episode), the characters a lot more transparent, and the themes a lot more sharp.

It's honestly a more interesting work meta-contextually than it is textually. Much of the fun comes from it playing with your expectations, then slyly making fun of you for having been played, and then you playing along anyway because _WHO_ spoils a major plot beat out of nowhere like 5 times, then has the absolute gall and confidence to still make the spoiled episode just as good anyway.

Fun on first watch, and I suspect it'll be just as fun on rewatch.

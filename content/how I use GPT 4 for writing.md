1. I prompt GPT 4 to write something
2. I prompt GPT 4 for critique
3. I prompt GPT 4 to rewrite the thing, taking critique and extra information into consideration
4. Repeat from step 2

I can iterate faster than I could ever write it myself. Human writing scales linearly with time (and is dependent on motivation), iteration, even with a weak agent, scales exponentially.

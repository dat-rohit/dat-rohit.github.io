Problem statement: Define a minimal conlang (such as tokipona) in english, and see if the LLM can communicate coherently with it.
- Similar to doing code inference, but the design spec of a conlang could fit into a prompt easily (and is also verbal, as opposed to being a giant compiler)
- Can/Would they invent new vocabulary/ how would they interpret grammar rules when not trained but described?
